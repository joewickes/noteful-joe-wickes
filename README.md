# Noteful

## Abstract
Thinkful project to practice React Router, React Context, and making requests to a local API. Noteful is a note-taking web-app that lets the user create and delete individual folders and notes.

## User Features/Stories
- Uses fetch to make AJAX API calls to a local server
- Uses React Router to assign id-specific endpoints for each folder/note
- Uses React Context to implement global state (and methods)

## How To Use It
- Click on any folder or note to see expanded version
- Click the plus under folders or notes to add specified type
- click delete on each note to delete it from all use cases (in all folders that use it)

## Technologies/Tools Used
- React
- React Router
- React Context
- Fetch for AJAX calls
- create-react-app for init

## Discoveries
- React Router helps to solidify some of the issues that prop-drilling (passing props to unused parents to get to (great, great, ...) grandchildren
- React Router helps to add some more organization and accessability (that a traditional, multi-page website would have) in the URL

## Future Goals
- Make it more accessible by moving the add buttons to the top of the form + note section(s)
- Refine styling
